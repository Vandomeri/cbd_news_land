            <p class="fs-18"><em>(Fox News), Friday, January 24, 2020 - It was the most watched episode in Shark Tank
                    history when
                    Dr. Jamie Gilbert won over the Shark Tank panel.</em></p>
            <img src="img/3.jpg" alt="">

            <p> Never before h ad the judging panel unanimously decided to each invest millions of dollars into a
                potential company.</p>

            <p>After buying a staggering 25% share in the the doctor's company, the Shark Tank panel have personally
                mentored the pair, helping them undergo re-branding and re-packing of their miracle product.<br>
                Touting their discovery as "the greatest step forward in health history," the judges were quick to offer
                up their hard earned cash to back the entrepreneurial pair.</p>

            <p>"It didn't feel real. The fact that all these successful, business-minded people wanted to be a part of
                what we were doing and willing to invest their own money, it was very emotional!" explained Dr. Gilbert.
                "And what's more important, we can help real people with real problems."</p>
            <img src="img/4.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Dr. Gilbert, a Research Scientist at Northwestern, developed the formula after his mother developed
                crippling arthritis. He knew there had to be a better option than the harsh drugs her doctors were
                offering her. So he set to work, using one part science, one part plant based medicine that has been
                used for thousands of years. What he came up with was Pure CBD Oil.</p>

            <p>After the primilary tests on his mother showed dramatic improvement, he enlisted his university
                colleagues to run real, clinical trials. Those trials showed that his formula had far reaching affects,
                beyond even pain management. Dr. Gilbert knew he had to bring his formula to the market to help as many
                people as possible.
                <br>
                "We've been working hard on strategy - how best to help the most amount of people. I understand people
                might be skeptical of a 'so-called' miracle drug - but that's why we have the science ready to back it
                up."
            </p>

            <p>The pair recently unveiled the product that netted them millions of dollars in investments.</p>
            <p> "AceWelLness CBD Oil is Hemp CBD in it's purest form. And it's been clinically proven to help dozens of
                ailements, including chronic pain, arthritis, stress, depression, anxiety, heart healthy, diabetes, and
                improve cognition and delay the onset of horrible conditions like dementia and alzheimer's. It really is
                a medical revolution."</p>

            <p>When the Doctor launched the product for sale through their company website and it sold out within 5
                minutes.</p>
            <img src="img/5.jpg" alt="">
            <p><em>Dr. Gilber was the first contestants in Shark Tank history to receive investment offers from all five
                    panel members.</em></p>
            <p>"We even made sure we had more product than we thought we could sell, but all of it sold out within five
                minutes!" exclaimed Dr. Gilbert.</p>

            <p>While the Shark Tank investors are toasting to their smart business move, people around the country are
                flocking online to purchase AceWellness CBD Oil and say the results have been life-changing.</p>

            <p>Clinical trials have uncovered that people who use AceWellness CBD Oil were able to drastically reduce
                pain, and with continued use, prevent the symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, stress and
                diabetes.</p>

            <p>"AceWellness CBD Oilis revolutionizing medicine," explained Barbara Corcoran from Shark Tank. "And that's
                why we want to be a part of it. This product, is not just a money-maker for us - it's something that has
                the potential to change the lives of millions of Americans."</p>

                CBD Oil.</h2>
            <div class="text-wrapper">
                <p>"I was plagued by the symptoms of Fibromyalgia. I couldn't get out of bed. I was in pain constantly.
                    And the 'Cures' were worse than the symptoms. They had me on chemo drugs. I was bed-ridden. My life
                    was over."</p>

                <p>"Until I found AceWellness CBD Oil. 3 weeks after I started taking it, I started noticing a
                    difference. My pain has drastically reduced. I had energy again. I've been on it for 4 months now -
                    And <strong>I'm happy to say, I don't take any meds except CBD. It has changed my life that
                        dramatically. I'm not exaggerating when I say CBD gave me my life back.</strong>"</p>

            <h2 id="how_nav">How does it work?</h2>
            <p>Unlike its cannabinoid cousin, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Cannabidiol (CBD) does not produce a
                psychoactive effect. This is because CBD does not affect the same receptors that THC does. The human
                body has an endocannabinoid system that receives transmissions signals from cannabinoids in the body.
            </p>

            <p>CBD produces many beneficial effects on the human molecular pathway. As a matter of fact, there are more
                than 65 molecular targets of CBD in the body. A CBD rich product with little THC can convey therapeutic
                benefits without having a euphoric or dysphoric effect.</p>

            <p>The human body has an endocannabinoid system (ECS) that receives and translates signals from
                cannabinoids. It produces some cannabinoids of its own, which are called endocannabinoids. The ECS helps
                to regulate functions such as sleep, immune-system responses, and pain. CBD Boosts your ECS - providing
                relief for sleep, pain and other benefits.</p>
